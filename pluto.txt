It is so a planet!

It's not a planet, it's a celestial dwarf!

Pluto was the ruler of the underworld in classical (Greek) mythology. The earlier name
for the god was Hades, which became more common as the name of the underworld
itself. In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pluto represents a more
positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife. Ploutōn was
frequently conflated with Ploutos (Πλοῦτος, Plutus), who was a god of wealth, because
mineral wealth was found underground, and because as a chthonic god Pluto ruled
the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest.
