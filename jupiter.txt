Jupiter is far more interesting.
Meh. If you think so!	
Yes, it is! I promise!
It's a giant ball!
and haven't you seen the aurora?
It's amazing! 
Much better than the northern lights!
But I just like Earth a lot more!

Jupiter is the best, but watch the weather forecast. Big storms!

Can't really match these, but keep going!

Jupiter is the largest planet and named after the king of the Roman gods
